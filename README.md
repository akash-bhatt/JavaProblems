# Neighbour Problem

1. Cell States are represented by 0 or 1. 
2. If Left Neighbour and Right Neighbour are equal then state in inactive
3. For left most and right most cell, consider neighbour as 0
4. Write a program to determine state of array after x days
5. Test Cases as added in Test Cases.


# GCD Problem

The greatest common divider (GCD), also called highest common factor(HCF) of N numbers is the largesty positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remainder

Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers

INPUT
The input to the method consistes of two arguments - 
num, an integer representing the number of positive integers(N).
arr, a list of positive integers
e.g. num=5
arr [2,4,6,8,10]

OUTPUT
returns an integer representing the GCD of the given positive integers
e.g. (from above input) 2

The largest positive integer that divides all the positive integers 2,4,6,8,10 without a remainder is 2

TestCase 1
Input:
5
[2,3,4,5,6]

Expected Output
1

TestCase 2
Input:
5
[2,4,6,8,10]

Expected Output
2

#CeaserCipher
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
